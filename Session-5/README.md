Session -5 Experiments
Step - 1
```
Target:
    > Design the base model along with LR scheduler
    > Less than or equal to 15 Epochs
    > Less than 10000 Parameters
Results:
    > Parameters: 7.68k
    > Best Train Accuracy: 98.84
    > Best Test Accuracy: 99.07 (15th Epoch)
Analysis:
    The base model test accuracy reached upto 99.07% while train accuracy was 98.84 which indicates minor underfitting

```

Step - 2
```
Target:
    > Using the same base mode,add image augmentations

Results:
    > Parameters: 7.68k
    > Best Train Accuracy: 98.72
    > Best Test Accuracy: 99.18 (12th Epoch),99.15(14th Epoch)
Analysis:
    The base model test accuracy was stuck at 99.1% while train accuracy was not improving above 98.72
